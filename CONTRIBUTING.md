## üìù Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React best practices**
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **PropTypes** or **TypeScript** for type checking
- Keep components **small and focused**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good
const SearchInput = ({ value, onChange, placeholder }) => {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={value}
      onChange={onChange}
      placeholder={placeholder}
      className="search-input"
    />
  )
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
const Component = (props) => {
  // Large component with multiple responsibilities
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Use **semantic class names** when custom CSS is needed
- Maintain **consistent spacing** using Tailwind's scale

```jsx
// ‚úÖ Good
<div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors">
    Submit
  </button>
</div>

// ‚ùå Avoid
<div style={{display: 'flex', padding: '16px'}}>
  <button style={{backgroundColor: '#3B82F6'}}>Submit</button>
</div>
```

### File Organization
